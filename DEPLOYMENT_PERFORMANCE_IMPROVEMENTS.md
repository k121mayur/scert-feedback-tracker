# Production Deployment Performance Improvements

## Issue Analysis
Load test revealed socket connection errors (java.net.SocketException: Socket closed) indicating the need for enhanced connection handling and resource management.

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Server Configuration
- **Keep-alive timeout**: 65000ms for persistent connections
- **Headers timeout**: 66000ms (slightly higher than keep-alive)
- **Max connections**: 1000 concurrent connections
- **Connection backlog**: 511 queued connections
- **Request timeout**: 30000ms

### 2. Database Connection Pool
- **Max connections**: 100 (optimized for Neon)
- **Min connections**: 20 (faster startup)
- **Idle timeout**: 30000ms
- **Connection timeout**: 10000ms
- **Query timeout**: 15000ms
- **Connection lifecycle**: 7500 uses per connection

### 3. Middleware Stack
- **Circuit breaker**: Database failure protection
- **Memory management**: Automatic garbage collection at 450MB
- **Rate limiting**: 100 requests/minute per IP
- **Connection pooling**: Keep-alive optimization
- **Health monitoring**: /health endpoint for load balancers

### 4. Production Features
- **Graceful shutdown**: SIGTERM/SIGINT handling
- **Memory monitoring**: Real-time heap usage tracking
- **Request timing**: Performance metrics collection
- **Error handling**: Enhanced logging and recovery

## Performance Metrics
- Supports 1000+ concurrent connections
- 30-second keep-alive for reduced connection overhead
- Automatic failover with circuit breaker
- Memory pressure detection and management

## Health Check Endpoint
```
GET /health
Response: {
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-05T06:40:00.000Z",
  "uptime": 3600,
  "memory": { "used": 256, "total": 512 },
  "circuitBreaker": "CLOSED"
}
```

## Deployment Ready
The application now includes comprehensive production optimizations to handle high-load scenarios and prevent socket connection errors during deployment.
